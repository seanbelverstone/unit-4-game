    <p>There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points
    to your total score.</p>
    <p>You win the game by matching your total score to the random number provided and you lose the game
        if your total score goes above the random number.</p>
    <p>The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.</p>
    <p>Each time when the game starts the game will change the value of each crystal.</p>
